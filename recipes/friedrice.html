            <li>Liver</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <p>First you might want to start with your protein, either boiling or grilling it</p>
        <p>For this tutorial i'll be boiling it because of the stock</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash your rice thoroughly about 3-4 times and set aside</li>
            <li>Boil your protein having marinated it for some hours with your seasonings</li>
            <li>Remove the boiled protein from the water and set aside</li>
            <li>Fry the protein with Oil or grill the protein till it's like golden brown like in the above image</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a pot, i like to toast my rice first with onions</li>
            <li>Pour some onions in the pan after heating up the oil</li>
            <li>Fry the onions for a while and add the washed rice</li>
            <li>Toast for 3 mins and whilst toastinng add curry till it's green</li>
            <li>Proceed to add your desired seasonings</li>
            <li>Add in the meat stock from earlier and add some water to make it slightly above the rice cos we want to maintain a good texture</li>
            <li>Now add an aluminium foil paper on the top to cover and cook it under low to medium heat</li>
            <li>Now the veggies, cut your veggies into your desired shape and size</li>
            <li>Get a fry pan add little oil, when heated up, throw in your veggies and stir fry together with the Liver</li>
            <li>After 2 mins in add your seasonings and make sure the curry is slightly more</li>
            <li>Stir fry for about 3 mins again and add the already cooked rice in and stir</li>
            Make sure the rice is already soft before adding into the veggies. That should be all.
