                <li>½ large onion, diced</li>

                <li>3 cups parboiled rice</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken drumsticks or any protein of your choice in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Mix well with the spices listed. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.</li>
                <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes</li>
                <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
